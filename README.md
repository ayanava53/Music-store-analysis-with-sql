This Music Store Data Analysis project aims to extract valuable insights and make data-driven decisions to optimize the operations of a music store. This project involves the use of Structured Query Language (SQL) to query and analyze a dataset containing information about music sales, customer behavior, and inventory. By examining this data, the project seeks to provide actionable recommendations for improving the store's profitability, inventory management, and customer experience.
